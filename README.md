### üèÜ Highlighted Projects

#### **Fully Automated PCBs Recycling Production Line (FABRL)**
* An award-winning graduation project to recycle PCBs and extract Copper (99.98% pure), gold, and silver.
* The system is controlled by an ARM-based MCU and utilizes an ESP8266 for IoT monitoring and remote control of the entire factory, which includes shredding, grinding, and separation machines.

#### **Hotel Reservation System API**
* Architected a complete backend service for a hotel reservation platform using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
* Engineered a secure, stateless authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and implemented a full password reset feature with Nodemailer.
* Designed a granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for Customer, Manager, and Super Admin roles and bolstered API security with middleware for data sanitization, rate limiting, and XSS protection.

#### **E-commerce App API**
* Developed a scalable and secure backend for an e-commerce platform with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
* Engineered a complete order processing workflow by integrating the Stripe API for payments and the Cloudinary API for product image management.
* Implemented a comprehensive authentication module with JWT, role-based access control, and an automated email verification/password reset system.

#### **Custom Bootloader & FOTA**
* Developed a custom bootloader from scratch for an STM32F103C8T6 (Cortex-M3) MCU.
* The bootloader supports secure and reliable Firmware-Over-The-Air (FOTA) updates, featuring flash partitioning, CRC checks, rollback safeguards, and an HTTP/MQTT-based client for seamless remote upgrades.
